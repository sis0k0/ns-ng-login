# NativeScript Angular Login HMR Demo

This application contains a simple login form with a [Kinvey](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/nativescript/guides/getting-started) backend and state management with [Akita](https://github.com/datorama/akita). You can use it with HMR. It works pretty well.

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

2. Install NativeScript CLI 5.0. Or NativeScript CLI rc if you are reading this before Nov, 2018.

```
npm i -g nativescript@rc
```

3. Run the application

```
tns run android --hmr
```

> Note: The `tns run android --hmr` command will start working when NativeScript 5.0 is officially released.
