# NativeScript Angular Login HMR Demo

This application contains a simple login form with a [Kinvey](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/nativescript/guides/getting-started) backend and state management with [Akita](https://github.com/datorama/akita). You can use it with HMR. It works pretty well.

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

2. Install NativeScript CLI 5.0. Or NativeScript CLI rc if you are reading this before Nov, 2019.

```
npm i -g nativescript@rc
```

3. Run the preview command

```
tns preview --hmr
```

4. Follow the instructions printed by the command. You will need a mobile device and the NativeScript Preview app installed on it.

5. Play around, change code, see the HMR magic.
